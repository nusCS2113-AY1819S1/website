                <p>Detection:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or renaming methods/variables.</li>
                  <li>As all your work is publicly visible on GitHub, sooner or later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>For submissions not affecting marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest
                    students to do better rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
                  <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>

                            code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication. Individual members are responsible for making sure code attributed to them are correct. If you notice a team member claiming

                <li>Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour 30 min, 30 marks)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Both papers will be given to you at the start but you need to <strong>answer Part 1 first</strong> (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be <strong>collected 30 min after the exam start time</strong> (even if arrived late for the exam). You are free
                to start part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.</p>
              <h2 id="final-exam-part-1-mcq">Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)</h2>
              <p>Each MCQ question gives you a statement to evaluate.</p>
              <tip-box>
                <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> An example statement</p>

              <p>The exam paper has 50 questions. All questions carry equal marks.</p>
              <p><mark>The weightage of the Part 1 of the final exam is 25 marks out of the total score of 100.</mark></p>
              <p>Note that you have <strong>slightly more than ½ minute for each question</strong>, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.</p>
              <p>Given the fast pace required by the paper, to be fair to all students, <strong>you will not be allowed to clarify doubts about questions</strong> (in Part 1) by talking to invigilators.</p>
              <p><strong>Questions in Part 1 are confidential.</strong> You are not allowed to reveal Part 1 content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the assessment paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.</p>
              <p>You will be given OCR forms to indicate your answers for Part 1.</p>
              <p><strong>The paper is open-book</strong>: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format. However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the
                exam.</p>
              <p>💡 <strong>Mark the OCR form as you go</strong>, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: Given there are 50 questions and only 30 mins, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.</span></p>
              <p>💡 <strong>Write the answer in the exam paper as well</strong> as marking it in the OCR form. <span class="dimmed"> Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.</span></p>
              <p>💡 We have tried to <strong>avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions</strong>. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.</p>

              <p>Unlike in part 1, <strong>you can ask invigilators for clarifications</strong> if you found a question to be unclear in part 2.</p>
              <p>Yes, <strong>you may use pencils</strong> when answering part 2.</p>

                        <p>Here is another definition of testing:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain.
                            <sub>-– source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3">Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3</a></sub></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
                          <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                          <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                          <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

                      <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>First, we feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>
                        <li>Next, we compare the actual output file with another file containing the expected output.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>

                          <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>.

                              <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br> e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                                <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                            </span>
                            <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>                              operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                            <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                            <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or
                              any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                          <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as
                            <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>

                      </ol>
                      <p>Note that the above technique is only suitable when testing CLI apps, and only if the exact output can be predetermined. <span class="dimmed">If the output varies from one run to the other (e.g. it contains a time stamp), this technique will not work. In those cases we need more sophisticated ways of automating tests.</span></p>

                      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                      <tip-box>
                        <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer
                            with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                            When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil
                            it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Consider a simple movie ticket vending machine application. Every week, the theatre staff will enter the weekly schedule as well as ticket price for each show. A customer sees the schedule and the ticket price displayed at
                              the machine. There is a slot to insert money, a keypad to enter a code for a movie, a code for the show time, and the number of tickets. A display shows the customer's balance inside the machine. A customer may choose to
                              cancel a transaction before pressing the “buy” button. Printed tickets can be collected from a slot at the bottom of the machine. The machine also displays messages such as &quot;Please enter more money”, “Request fewer tickets&quot;
                              or &quot;SOLD OUT!”. Finally, a &quot;Return Change&quot; button allows the customer to get back his unspent money.</p>

                            <p>The system is to be used by Testers, Programmers and System Administrators. Only an administrator can create new users and assign tasks to programmers. Any tester can create a bug report, as well as set the status of a bug
                              report as ‘closed’. Only a programmer can set the state of a bug report to ‘fixed’, but a programmer cannot set the status of a bug report to ‘closed’. Each tester is assigned just one task at a time. A task involves testing
                              of a particular component for a particular customer. Tester must document the bugs they find. Each bug is given a unique identifier. Other information recorded about the bug is component id, severity, date and time reported,
                              programmer who is assigned to fix it, date fixed, date retested and date closed. The system keeps track of which bugs are assigned to which programmer at any given time. It should be able to generate reports on the number
                              of bugs found, fixed and closed e.g. number of bugs per component and per customer; number of bugs found by a particular tester ; number of bugs awaiting to be fixed; number of bugs awaiting to be retested; number of bugs

                              <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The given description contains information not relevant to use case modeling. Furthermore, the description is not enough to complete the use case diagram All these are realities of real projects.
                                However, the process of trying to create this use case diagram prompts us to investigate issues such as:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Is ‘edit bug report’ a use case or editing the bug report is covered by other use cases such as those for setting the status of bug reports? If it is indeed a separate use case, who are the actors of that use case?</li>
                                <li>Does ‘assign task’ simply means ‘assign bug report’ or is there any other type of tasks?</li>
                                <li>There was some mention about Customers and Components. Does the system have to support use cases for creating and maintaining details about those entities? For example, should we have a ‘create customer record’ use case?</li>
                                <li>Which actors can perform the ‘generate report’ use case? Are reports generated automatically by the system at a specific time or generated ‘on demand’ when users request to view them? Do we have to treat different types
                                  of reports as different use cases (in case some types of reports are restricted to some types of users)? The above diagram assumes (just for illustration) that the report is generated on demand and only the system admin
                                  can generate any report.</li>

                      <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the <strong>MSS should be self-contained</strong>. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario.</p>

                    <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
                      <img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
                    <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
                      <img src="/website/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
                    <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code>                      is not to be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
                    <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read.
                      Note that there is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
                    <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
                      <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
                      <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
                      <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify
                      requirements.</p>

                        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Consider the following <code>Box</code> class. It can be used only for storing <code>Integer</code> objects.</p>

</code></pre>
                        <p>To store <code>String</code> objects, another similar class is needed, resulting in the duplication of the entire class. As you can see, if you need to store many different types of objects, you could end up writing many similar
                          classes.</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">BoxForString</span> </span>{

    }

</code></pre>
                        <p>One solution for this problem is to use <em>polymorphism</em> i.e., write the <code>Box</code> class to store <code>Object</code> objects.</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Box</span> </span>{

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> x;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                        <p>The problem with this solution is, since its methods accept or return an <code>Object</code>, you are free to pass in whatever you want, provided that it is not one of the primitive types. There is no way to verify, at compile
                          time, how the class is used. One part of the code may place an <code>Integer</code> in the box and expect to get <code>Integers</code> out of it, while another part of the code may mistakenly pass in a <code>String</code>, resulting
                          in a runtime error.
                        </p>
                      </box>
                      <p><strong>Generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods.</strong> Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations, type parameters provide a
                        way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types.</p>

                        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> A <em>generic</em> <code>Box</code> class allows you to define what type of elements will be put in the <code>Box</code>. For example, you can instantiate a <code>Box</code> object to keep <code>Integer</code>                          elements so that any attempt to put a non-<code>Integer</code> object in that <code>Box</code> object will result in a compile error.</p>

                      <p><strong>A <em>collection</em> — sometimes called a <em>container</em> — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.</strong> Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate
                        data.</p>
                      <box>
                        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Typically, collections represent data items that form a natural group, such as a poker hand (a collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters), or a telephone directory (a mapping
                          of names to phone numbers).</p>
                      </box>
                      <p><strong>The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.</strong> It contains the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Interfaces</strong>: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface can be used to manipulate list-like collections which may be implemented in different ways such as <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code>                            or <code>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code>.</span><br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Implementations</strong>: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code> class implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface while the <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> class implements the <code>Map&lt;K, V&gt;</code>                            interface.</span><br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as <em>searching</em> and <em>sorting</em>, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic:
                            that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>sort(List&lt;E&gt;)</code> method can sort a collection that implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface.</span>
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success"><span class="fas fa-equals"></span></span>
                        </span> <strong>A well-known example of collections frameworks is the C++ <em>Standard Template Library (STL)</em></strong>. <span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"><span class="fas fa-not-equal"></span></span>
                        </span>
                        Although both are collections frameworks and the syntax look similar, note that there are important philosophical and implementation differences between the two.</p>
                      <p>The following list describes the core collection interfaces:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Collection</code></strong> — the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Collection interface is the least common denominator that all collections
                            implement and is used to pass collections around and to manipulate them when maximum generality is desired. Some types of collections allow duplicate elements, and others do not. Some are ordered and others are unordered. The
                            Java platform doesn't provide any direct implementations of this interface but provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces, such as <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code>. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html"><code>Collection</code> API</a>.</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Set</code></strong> — a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface models the mathematical set abstraction and is used to represent sets, such as the cards comprising a poker hand, the courses
                            making up a student's schedule, or the processes running on a machine. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Set.html"><code>Set</code> API</a>.</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>List</code></strong> — an ordered collection (sometimes called a <em>sequence</em>). <code>List</code>s can contain duplicate elements. The user of a <code>List</code> generally has precise control over where in
                            the list each element is inserted and can access elements by their integer index (position). <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/List.html"><code>List</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Queue</code></strong> — a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Besides basic <code>Collection</code> operations, a <code>Queue</code> provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection
                            operations. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                    <p><strong>An <em>Enumeration</em> is a fixed set of values that can be considered as a data type.</strong> An enumeration is often useful when using a regular data type such as <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> would allow invalid
                      values to be assigned to a variable. <strong>You are recommended to enumeration types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.</strong></p>
                    <box>
                      <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Suppose you want a variable to store the priority of something. There are only three priority levels: high, medium, and low. You can declare the variable as of type <code>int</code> and use only
                        values <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> to indication the three priority levels. However, this opens the possibility of an invalid values such as <code>9</code> to be assigned to it. But if you define an enumeration
                        type called <code>Priority</code> that has three values <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, <code>LOW</code> only, a variable of type <code>Priority</code> will never be assigned an invalid value because the compiler is able
                        to catch such an error.</p>

                  <p><strong><mark><em>Branching</em></mark> is the process of evolving multiple versions of the software in parallel.</strong> For example, one team member can create a new branch and add an experimental feature to it while the rest of the
                    team keeps working on another branch. Branches can be given names e.g. <code>master</code>, <code>release</code>, <code>dev</code>.</p>
                  <p><strong>A branch can be <mark><em>merged</em></mark> into another branch.</strong> Merging usually result in a new commit that represents the changes done in the branch being merged.</p>

      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>Within your team</strong></p>
      <ul>

                            <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain.

                            <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                            <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                            <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

                        <p>Regression testing is more effective when it is done frequently, after each small change. However, doing so can be prohibitively expensive if testing is done manually. Hence, <strong>regression testing is more practical when it is automated</strong>.</p>

                        <p><strong>A simple way to semi-automate testing of a CLI(Command Line Interface) app is by using input/output re-direction.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>First, we feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>

                            <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>.

                                <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br> e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                                  <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>

                                <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                              <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>                                operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                              <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                              <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or
                                any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                            <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as
                              <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>

                        <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early stages of requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
                        <tip-box>
                          <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer
                              with others?). A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br>                              When discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil
                              it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </tip-box>
                      </div>
                      <p>While use cases can be recorded on
                        <tooltip content="e.g. index cards or sticky notes">physical paper</tooltip> in the initial stages, an online tool is more suitable for longer-term management of user stories, especially if the team is not

<p><em>Extreme programming (XP)</em> is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent &quot;releases&quot; in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.  [wikipedia, 2017.05.01]</p></div></popover></span>                        uses User stories to capture requirements.
                        <p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/userstories.html">This page</a> in their website explains the difference between user stories and traditional requirements.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>One of the biggest misunderstandings with user stories is how they differ from traditional requirements specifications. The biggest difference is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make
                            a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story developers will go to the customer and receive a detailed description of the requirements face to face.</p>

                        <p>Note that the numbering style is not a universal rule but a widely used convention. Based on that convention,</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>either of the extensions marked <code>3a.</code> and <code>3b.</code> can happen just after step <code>3</code> of the MSS.</li>
                          <li>the extension marked as <code>*a.</code> can happen at any step (hence, the <code>*</code>).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When separating extensions from the MSS, keep in mind that the <strong>MSS should be self-contained</strong>. That is, the MSS should give us a complete usage scenario.</p>
                        <p>Also note that it is not useful to mention events such as power failures or system crashes as extensions because the system cannot function beyond such catastrophic failures.</p>

                      <p>This section uses extracts from the <small><span style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="badge badge-secondary">-- Java Tutorial</span></span></small>, with some adaptations.</p>
                      <p><strong>A <em>collection</em> — sometimes called a <em>container</em> — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.</strong> Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate
                        data.</p>
                      <box>
                        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Typically, collections represent data items that form a natural group, such as a poker hand (a collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters), or a telephone directory (a mapping
                          of names to phone numbers).</p>
                      </box>
                      <p><strong>The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.</strong> It contains the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Interfaces</strong>: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface can be used to manipulate list-like collections which may be implemented in different ways such as <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code>                            or <code>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code>.</span><br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Implementations</strong>: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code> class implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface while the <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> class implements the <code>Map&lt;K, V&gt;</code>                            interface.</span><br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as <em>searching</em> and <em>sorting</em>, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic:
                            that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>sort(List&lt;E&gt;)</code> method can sort a collection that implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface.</span>
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success"><span class="fas fa-equals"></span></span>
                        </span> <strong>A well-known example of collections frameworks is the C++ <em>Standard Template Library (STL)</em></strong>. <span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"><span class="fas fa-not-equal"></span></span>
                        </span>
                        Although both are collections frameworks and the syntax look similar, note that there are important philosophical and implementation differences between the two.</p>
                      <p>The following list describes the core collection interfaces:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Collection</code></strong> — the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Collection interface is the least common denominator that all collections
                            implement and is used to pass collections around and to manipulate them when maximum generality is desired. Some types of collections allow duplicate elements, and others do not. Some are ordered and others are unordered. The
                            Java platform doesn't provide any direct implementations of this interface but provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces, such as <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code>. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html"><code>Collection</code> API</a>.</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Set</code></strong> — a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface models the mathematical set abstraction and is used to represent sets, such as the cards comprising a poker hand, the courses
                            making up a student's schedule, or the processes running on a machine. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Set.html"><code>Set</code> API</a>.</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>List</code></strong> — an ordered collection (sometimes called a <em>sequence</em>). <code>List</code>s can contain duplicate elements. The user of a <code>List</code> generally has precise control over where in
                            the list each element is inserted and can access elements by their integer index (position). <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/List.html"><code>List</code> API</a>.</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Queue</code></strong> — a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Besides basic <code>Collection</code> operations, a <code>Queue</code> provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection
                            operations. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                        <li>
                          <p><strong><code>Map</code></strong> — an object that maps keys to values. A <code>Map</code> cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html"><code>Map</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                      <p><strong>An <em>Enumeration</em> is a fixed set of values that can be considered as a data type.</strong> An enumeration is often useful when using a regular data type such as <code>int</code> or <code>String</code> would allow invalid
                        values to be assigned to a variable. <strong>You are recommended to enumeration types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.</strong></p>
                      <box>
                        <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Suppose you want a variable to store the priority of something. There are only three priority levels: high, medium, and low. You can declare the variable as of type <code>int</code> and use only
                          values <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> to indication the three priority levels. However, this opens the possibility of an invalid values such as <code>9</code> to be assigned to it. But if you define an enumeration
                          type called <code>Priority</code> that has three values <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, <code>LOW</code> only, a variable of type <code>Priority</code> will never be assigned an invalid value because the compiler is able
